# Research internship - Image segmentation by superpixels

Disclaimer: work in progress.

Keywords: Python, PyTorch, Deep Learning, Image Segmentation

- The `cnn` directory contains the scripts for the convolutional neural network.
- The `segm` directory contains the scripts for the superpixel segmentation.
- The `report` directory contains the sources for the report (pdf version can be found [here](report/main.pdf)).

> :warning: currently changing the structure of the repo.

## To do

- [ ] `cnn`
    - [ ] sort `cnn` codes (modules, net)
    - [ ] `README.md` in `cnn`
    - [ ] put `cnn\results\results.py` file in `notebooks`
    - [ ] `README.md` in `cnn\results`
- [ ] `data`
    - [ ] `README.md` in `data`
- [ ] `notebooks`
    - [ ] convert `.py` files into `notebooks`
    - [ ] `README.md` in `notebooks`
- [x] `report`
- [x] `segm`
    - [x] `README.md` in `segm`
- [ ] this `README.md`
